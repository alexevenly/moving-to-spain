### **Comprehensive Checklist for Buying a Used 2004 Subaru Outback 2.5 (Manual, Non-Turbo)**

#### **1. Exterior Inspection**
- **Rust and Body Condition**
  - Inspect for rust in common areas: wheel arches, under the doors, rear quarters, and around the windshield.
  - Check the paint for fading, clear coat peeling, or mismatched panels (may indicate past repairs or accidents).
  - Look for dents, scratches, or signs of poorly done bodywork.
- **Lights and Glass**
  - Test all lights: headlights (high/low beams), taillights, brake lights, turn signals, and reverse lights.
  - Examine the windshield and windows for cracks, chips, or pitting that could impair visibility.
- **Wipers and Weather Seals**
  - Verify the condition of the windshield wiper blades (replace if cracked or streaking).
  - Check rubber seals around doors, windows, and the tailgate for cracks or deterioration due to age.

#### **2. Interior Inspection**
- **Seats and Upholstery**
  - Look for tears, stains, or excessive wear on seats (cloth or leather).
  - Ensure all seats adjust properly and folding mechanisms (rear seats) function.
- **Dashboard and Controls**
  - Inspect the dashboard for cracks, fading, or sun damage.
  - Test all electronics: radio, CD player, air conditioning, heater, power windows, power locks, and interior lights.
  - Confirm the instrument cluster works (speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge) with no warning lights staying on.
- **Carpets and Headliner**
  - Check carpets for water stains, mold, or excessive wear (lift mats if possible).
  - Inspect the headliner for sagging, tears, or discoloration.
- **Safety Features**
  - Test all seat belts for smooth operation and proper retraction.
  - Check for airbag deployment signs or an illuminated airbag warning light.

#### **3. Mechanical Inspection**
- **Engine**
  - **Head Gasket Issues**: The 2.5L non-turbo engine is prone to head gasket failures. Look for:
    - Oil leaks around the head gaskets (under the engine or on the block).
    - Milky oil on the dipstick or cap (indicates coolant mixing with oil).
    - Overheating or temperature gauge fluctuations during operation.
  - **Fluid Levels and Condition**:
    - Check engine oil level and condition (should be clean, not gritty or milky).
    - Inspect coolant level and color (should be bright, not rusty or oily).
    - Look for leaks under the engine bay (oil, coolant, or other fluids).
  - **Timing Belt**:
    - Verify if the timing belt has been replaced (recommended every 105,000 miles). If overdue, budget for replacement.
  - **Engine Noise**:
    - Start the engine and listen for knocking, ticking, or rough idling, which could signal internal wear.
- **Transmission (Manual)**
  - Shift through all gears to ensure smooth operation without grinding, popping out, or resistance.
  - Test the clutch for slippage (e.g., revving in higher gears shouldn’t increase RPM without speed gain).
  - Check clutch pedal feel (should be firm, not spongy or too light).
- **Suspension and Steering**
  - Inspect shocks and struts for leaks or wear (oily residue is a bad sign).
  - Listen for clunking, squeaking, or rattling when driving over bumps.
  - Push down on each corner of the car to check for excessive bouncing (worn shocks).
  - Test steering for responsiveness, ensuring no excessive play or vibrations.
- **Brakes**
  - Check brake pads and rotors for wear (pads should have at least 3mm left; rotors should be smooth).
  - Inspect brake fluid level and condition (should be clear, not dark or murky).
  - Test brakes for smooth stopping without pulling, pulsation, or squealing.
- **Exhaust System**
  - Look under the car for rust, holes, or leaks in the exhaust pipes and muffler.
  - Listen for loud noises or rattling during acceleration (could indicate a failing exhaust).
- **Tires and Wheels**
  - Check tires for even wear (uneven wear suggests alignment or suspension issues).
  - Measure tread depth (at least 3mm remaining; use a penny test if needed).
  - Inspect wheels for cracks, bends, or curb rash.
- **All-Wheel Drive (AWD) System**
  - Test AWD functionality by driving on a low-traction surface (e.g., gravel) to ensure power distributes to all wheels.
  - Listen for whining or grinding from the differentials or transfer case.

#### **4. Service History and Documentation**
- **Maintenance Records**
  - Review records for regular oil changes, tune-ups, and scheduled maintenance.
  - Look for evidence of major services (e.g., timing belt, head gasket replacement).
- **Major Repairs**
  - Ask about past repairs to the engine, transmission, suspension, or AWD system.
  - Confirm if head gaskets have been replaced (a common repair for this model).
- **Vehicle History Report**
  - Obtain a report (e.g., Carfax or AutoCheck) to check for:
    - Accidents or structural damage.
    - Title issues (salvage, flood, or rebuilt titles).
    - Odometer rollbacks or discrepancies.

#### **5. Test Drive**
- **Engine Performance**
  - Ensure the engine starts easily (no excessive cranking) and idles smoothly.
  - Test acceleration for consistent power delivery without hesitation or stalling.
  - Listen for unusual noises (knocking, whining, or grinding) from the engine.
- **Transmission and Clutch**
  - Shift through all gears (including reverse) to confirm smooth engagement.
  - Test the clutch under load (e.g., accelerating uphill) for slipping or chatter.
- **Steering and Handling**
  - Drive on a straight road to ensure the car tracks straight without pulling.
  - Check for steering wheel vibrations at various speeds (e.g., 30 mph and highway speeds).
- **Braking**
  - Test brakes at low and high speeds for even stopping without noise or pedal pulsation.
  - Apply the parking brake to ensure it holds the car on an incline.
- **Climate Control**
  - Test the heater and air conditioning across all fan speeds and vent settings.
  - Ensure quick temperature changes and no unusual smells (e.g., mold or coolant).

#### **6. Additional Checks**
- **Spare Tire and Tools**
  - Confirm the spare tire, jack, and lug wrench are present and in usable condition.
- **Battery**
  - Check the battery’s age (look for a date stamp; most last 3-5 years).
  - Inspect terminals for corrosion and test voltage if possible (should be ~12.6V when off).
- **Undercarriage**
  - Look for rust, especially on the frame, subframe, and exhaust system (common in older Subarus).
  - Check for leaks from the engine, transmission, or differentials.
- **Mileage Consideration**
  - For high-mileage cars (over 150,000 miles), scrutinize the engine, transmission, and suspension condition.
  - Anticipate potential repairs (e.g., clutch, timing belt) if mileage is significant.

#### **7. Professional Inspection (Optional but Recommended)**
- Hire a trusted mechanic for a pre-purchase inspection, especially if you’re not confident in your assessment.
- A mechanic can identify hidden issues like frame damage, worn engine internals, or AWD problems.

### **Model-Specific Notes for the 2004 Subaru Outback 2.5 (Non-Turbo)**
- **Head Gasket Issues**: The 2.5L non-turbo engine is notorious for head gasket failures. Look for leaks, overheating, or coolant contamination in the oil.
- **Timing Belt**: This model has a timing belt (not a chain), requiring replacement every 105,000 miles. Check service history or plan for this expense.
- **Rust**: Vehicles from this era, especially in salt-heavy regions, often develop rust on the undercarriage and body. Inspect thoroughly.
- **AWD Reliability**: The AWD system is robust but costly to repair if neglected. Ensure it functions smoothly.

---

### **Final Tips**
- **Research Online**: Check Subaru forums (e.g., SubaruOutback.org) for owner-reported issues specific to the 2004 Outback.
- **Negotiate Wisely**: Use findings like worn components or overdue maintenance to negotiate the price.
- **Walk Away if Unsure**: If the car shows major red flags (e.g., severe rust, engine knocking), don’t hesitate to pass.

This checklist ensures a thorough evaluation of a used 2004 Subaru Outback 2.5 manual non-turbo, balancing general used car concerns with Subaru-specific quirks. Take your time inspecting and testing to avoid costly surprises with this nearly 20-year-old vehicle!
