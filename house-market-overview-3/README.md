#### Proximity to Ocean and Airport
The user’s requirement for ocean proximity (less than an hour, ideally 30-40 minutes) and airport access (less than 30 minutes, ideally 15-20 minutes) narrows the options. Coastal cities like Gijón, Avilés, Santander, Bilbao, and San Sebastián meet the ocean criterion, with driving times to the coast being immediate or very short. Inland cities like Oviedo (30 km, ~30 minutes to coast), Torrelavega (20 km, ~20 minutes), and Vitoria-Gasteiz (60 km to Bilbao, ~45 minutes) also fit, though slightly farther.

Airport access is crucial, with Santander Airport serving Cantabria (close to Santander and Torrelavega), Asturias Airport near Avilés and Gijón, and Bilbao Airport serving the Basque Country, including Castro-Urdiales. Specific distances include:
- Torrelavega: ~25 minutes to Santander Airport
- Avilés: ~15 minutes to Asturias Airport
- Castro-Urdiales: ~30 minutes to Bilbao Airport
- Gijón: ~30 minutes to Asturias Airport
- Santander: ~10 minutes to Santander Airport

These align with the user’s preferences, with some options like Santander and Avilés being particularly close to airports.

#### Nearby Big or Medium City for Services
The user requires access to a big or medium city for services like movie theaters, bookstores, and construction stores. This is met by:
- Torrelavega: Near Santander (~25 minutes), a medium city with all services.
- Avilés: A medium city itself (~80,000 population), with comprehensive services.
- Castro-Urdiales: Near Bilbao (~30 minutes), a large city with extensive amenities.
- Gijón and Santander are also medium to large cities, offering direct access to all required services.

#### Walkable Amenities: Veterinary, Pharmacy, and Supermarket
Ensuring veterinary, pharmacy, and supermarket access within 15-20 minutes by foot is essential. For Torrelavega, online listings confirm multiple veterinary clinics (e.g., Tomás Bustamante Veterinary Hospital, open 24 hours, rated 4.2), supermarkets (e.g., Carrefour, Mercadona, rated 4.0-4.4), and pharmacies, given its population of 50,000. Avilés, as a larger city, undoubtedly has these amenities within walking distance. Castro-Urdiales, with a population of ~30,000, likely has similar access, though specific data confirms veterinary and supermarket presence in nearby towns of similar size.

#### Detailed Comparison of Top Candidates
To provide a clear comparison, the following table outlines the top candidates based on all criteria:

| **Location**        | **Housing Price (€/m²)** | **Ocean Distance (min)** | **Airport Distance (min)** | **Nearby City** | **Amenities Walkable** |
|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Torrelavega         | 1,260                    | ~20                     | ~25 (Santander)            | Santander       | Yes                     |
| Avilés              | 1,890                    | 0 (on coast)            | ~15 (Asturias)             | Self-sufficient| Yes                     |
| Castro-Urdiales     | 1,798                    | 0 (on coast)            | ~30 (Bilbao)               | Bilbao          | Likely                  |

Torrelavega stands out for its low housing price and proximity to both ocean and airport, with Santander nearby for additional services. Avilés offers a larger city experience with slightly higher prices but excellent airport access. Castro-Urdiales provides a coastal option with moderate prices, though slightly farther from the airport.

#### Additional Considerations
Other areas like Pamplona and Vitoria-Gasteiz were considered, but their distance to the coast (around 1 hour and 45 minutes, respectively) makes them less ideal given the user’s preference for 30-40 minutes. Smaller coastal towns like Luanco and Suances were explored, but specific pricing data was limited, suggesting potential higher costs due to tourist appeal. The focus on Torrelavega, Avilés, and Castro-Urdiales ensures data-backed recommendations.

#### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, Torrelavega in Cantabria is recommended for its affordability (1,260 €/m²) and alignment with all criteria, offering a balance of cost, location, and amenities. Avilés and Castro-Urdiales are viable alternatives, particularly for those prioritizing city size or coastal proximity, with housing prices at 1,890 €/m² and 1,798 €/m², respectively. The user can choose based on preferences for town size, with Torrelavega providing the best value for budget-conscious relocation.
